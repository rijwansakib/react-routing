        "des": "Over the last few weeks the Wall Street Journal published a series of reports against Faceboo, alleging the company allowed the proliferation of hate speech on its platform and ignored the safety of teens on Instagram. These reports were based on internal documents WSJ reviewed. Today the whistleblower behind uncovering documents Frances Haugen appeared on the TV show 60 minutes to talk about why she decided to reveal some of Facebook’s secrets.Haugen 37 is a data scientist from Iowa with a bachelor’s degree in computer science and a master’s degree in business. She was a product manager at Facebook assigned to the Civic Integrity group which worked on risks to elections including misinformation. Prior to working at the social network giant she’s worked in some notable firms such as Google Yelp and Pinterest.She left her job in May after the Civic Integrity group was dissolved. However, before leaving, she copied thousands of documents, which she subsequently leaked to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and WSJ. According to the New York Times, she also worked with Whistleblower Aid, a legal nonprofit that helps people aiming to expose potential wrongdoings. During the interview, Haugen said that when she joined the company it was “substantially worse at Facebook than anything I’d seen before.” One of the documents she leaked indicates that Facebook takes action on only 3-5% of hate and 0.6% of violence and incitement content, despite claiming to be the best at it. She also emphasized that Facebook is creating divides in society, and content living on the platform can cause violence:When we live in an information environment that is full of angry, hateful, polarizing content it erodes our civic trust, it erodes our faith in each other, it erodes our ability to want to care for each other, the version of Facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world. In 2018, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook rolled out a change to an algorithm to potentially increase interactions between friends and family. Haugen said this change was at the root of the problems the social network is facing today.She said that Facebook is not using safer algorithms so that you spend more time on the site. Haugen said the company did turn on some safety features for the 2020 US Presidential elections, but turned them off as soon as the elections were over.Before Haugen’s interview aired, Facebook’s VP of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, appeared on CNN’s Reliable Sources, and said it’s ludicrous to think that social media was responsible for the Capitol Riots that took place in January.

        "des": "The battle for the best programming language is raging. But who will make it out on top? Just kidding, they’re all great, but we did check our database of job postings from over 6,000 tech companies across the globe to see which languages were most in-demand from employers. So, whether you’re a seasoned programmer with years of experience and a few languages under your belt, or you’re just starting out and trying to decide where to start, here are the top programming languages of 2021 (so far): #JavaScript According to Jobbio data, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language in terms of jobs posted on the website. According to the site, almost all roles relating to programming and engineering list JavaScript in the job requirements. Why is this? It’s considered to be the easiest programming language to learn, and most web browsers use it.Want to keep the TNW Conference vibe going?Tickets for TNW2022 are available nowJavaScript is used to manage the behavior of web pages. Coders can create dynamic web elements such as animated graphics, interactive maps, clickable buttons and more using JavaScript. Programmers who use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in tandem obtain a higher level of website control and can provide a better user experience in terms of navigation and readability.  #Python Following very closely behind JavaScript is Python, an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasises code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. In fact, a number of popular digital tools and platforms were developed with Python, including YouTube, Google Search, and iRobot machines.There has been an increase in the demand for Python developers over the last few years on Jobbio, a trend that has gone nowhere in 2021. Read more about the top jobs for Python programmers. # C# Another language that’s constantly in demand is C#. C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.   As with other popular languages, a large community works with C# and offers support to new learners. Because of this, learning C# may actually be easier than attempting to learn some of the newer and less-documented languages. # SQL SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language that allows programmers to query and manipulate databases. As a domain-specific language, it’s designed for managing data within an RDBMS. Basically, SQL can locate and retrieve data from a database, as well as update, add, or remove records. SQL allows developers to connect servers and databases for application programs such as Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. SQL also dominates the notable trend of cloud computing, which will, no doubt, continue to grow in popularity.",
